## Website Idea

* This website is a display of publications and at the same time it can be used as a news website or as a site to display articles as needed, where the site owner can enter the panel and add more than one user and control their powers.

* As I mentioned earlier, the site contains a special control panel, and the administrator can manage the entire website through it. I will now explain the divisions of the website in general.

### Note : The project/website is divided into three sections: 

* Dashboard Admin and Users or Members . 
* User Pages : display data from dashboard to user page .
* apis to mobile developer . -->
